# Hi, I'm Damilola Oladoke! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **passionate backend web developer** with a strong foundation in **Python** and **Django**, dedicated to building secure, scalable, and high-performance web applications. I thrive on transforming complex problems into seamless solutions and love optimizing systems to run efficiently.

With hands-on experience working on **RESTful APIs**, database management, and deploying optimized backend systems, Iâ€™m driven to deliver backend solutions that power the next generation of web experiences. Although I enjoy **frontend development**, my true passion lies in creating the backbone of applications that support robust and scalable functionalities.

## ðŸš€ What I Do Best:
- **Backend Development**: Python (Flask, Django), RESTful APIs
- **Database Management**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server
- **System Optimization**: Enhancing database performance, API integration, and backend security
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, CI/CD
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP (working on cloud deployment)

## ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring:
- Building **cutting-edge APIs** that integrate seamlessly with external systems
- **Database optimization** and advanced query tuning for performance at scale
- Strengthening knowledge of **web security** and **API penetration testing**

## ðŸ’¡ Recent Projects:
- **Labelbox Web App**: Optimized backend workflows with Flask and MySQL, improving task management efficiency by 40%.
- **Blog Website**: Built a secure Django-based blog platform with user authentication, analytics, and social features.
- **Lettuce Disease Classification**: Built a web-based AI tool for diagnosing lettuce diseases using MobileNetV2, achieving 98% accuracy in detecting healthy vs. diseased plants and 96% accuracy for specific diseases. Integrated Flask for a real-time interface and actionable recommendations.

## ðŸ’¬ Let's Connect!
Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on **backend-focused projects** that challenge the status quo and explore innovative solutions. If you're building something ambitious or need a backend expert to bring your ideas to life, let's talk!
